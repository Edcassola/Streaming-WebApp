I'm still building the Gargus, down here there's a list of what's left to do

- [x] Create all components
- [x] Create the Login Page
- [x] Connect to firebase
- [ ] build the application layout
- [ ] Make it responsive
- [ ] Create the Playlist
- [ ] Create the group function by 'moment of life'
- [ ] Make a (just for now) last commit
